Great! Now that your environment is set up, let’s move to **Step 2: Data Collection and Preparation** for our firefighter-specific LLM. In this step, we'll gather, clean, and structure the operational data and protocols that the model will learn from.

## Step 2: Data Collection and Preparation

### 2.1 Gather Relevant Firefighter Data

- **Identify Sources:**  
  Collect data from all available firefighter operational documents. This includes:
  - **Internal documents:** Protocols, incident reports, training manuals, and operational procedures (e.g., your “organisation pompiers.docx”, “initial web app functional overview.docx”, etc.).
  - **Public datasets and reports:** National or regional incident data (e.g., NFIRS reports, fire department case studies, and guidelines).
  - **Standard Operating Guidelines (SOGs):** Review materials like the "10 Standard Firefighting Orders" for context.

- **Supplement with External Data:**  
  Use publicly available resources to enrich your dataset. For example, articles like “4 Types of Data Every Fire Department Should Be Collecting” offer insights on key operational metrics that you might incorporate into your training data.

### 2.2 Clean and Filter the Data

- **Remove Noise:**  
  - Eliminate duplicates, irrelevant content, and any low-quality or outdated information.
  - Use regular expressions or dedicated data cleaning libraries (e.g., Python’s `pandas` and `re`) to standardize the text.
  
- **Ensure Data Quality:**  
  - Verify that the protocols and procedures are current and adhere to official standards.
  - Consider leveraging data moderation services if manual review is too resource-intensive.
  
- **Curate Domain-Specific Information:**  
  Focus on key elements such as operational orders, risk management protocols, incident response procedures, and communication guidelines.

### 2.3 Structure and Format Your Data

- **Define the Format:**  
  Convert your cleaned data into a structured format suitable for fine-tuning. For an instruction-based LLM, this typically means creating input-output pairs. For example:
  
  ```json
  {
      "instruction": "What is the protocol for handling a high-risk urban fire?",
      "input": "",
      "output": "According to the standard protocols, firefighters should update their status to 'en route', secure a safety zone, and notify the command center immediately..."
  }
  ```

- **Tokenization and Chunking:**  
  - Split long documents into manageable “chunks” (e.g., 512–1024 tokens) to ensure they fit within the model's context window.
  - Use a tokenizer (from Hugging Face’s Transformers library) to convert text into tokens and check the token count.

- **Metadata and Labeling:**  
  Add metadata to each entry if possible, such as the source document, date, and type of procedure. This will help in later evaluation and troubleshooting.

### 2.4 Validate the Prepared Dataset

- **Quality Checks:**  
  - Ensure that all data entries follow a consistent structure.
  - Manually inspect a sample of the dataset to confirm that the instructions, inputs, and outputs are correct and relevant.

- **Automated Tools:**  
  Use tools like Parlance Labs’ guidelines for creating, curating, and cleaning data for LLMs to automate parts of this process.

### Next Steps

Once your dataset is cleaned, structured, and validated, you’ll have a robust foundation for fine-tuning your firefighter LLM. In the next step, we’ll cover loading this dataset into your training pipeline and configuring your fine-tuning parameters.
