# Model Development Progress

## Phase 1: Initial Fine-tuning with Mistral-7B

### Base Model Selection
We initially chose Mistral-7B (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) for our first fine-tuning attempt due to:
- Strong performance across various tasks
- Good multilingual capabilities (important for French/English content)
- Reasonable model size (7B parameters)
- Open-source license
- Active community support

### Training Setup
- **Training Data**:
  - 56 training examples
  - Language distribution: French (62.5%), English (37.5%)
  - Categories: Protocols (50%), Training (42.9%), Incidents (7.1%)

- **Fine-tuning Approach**:
  - Using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient training
  - Parameters:
    - Rank (r): 8
    - Alpha: 32
    - Target modules: Query and Value projections
    - Dropout: 0.1

- **Training Configuration**:
  - Batch size: 4
  - Gradient accumulation steps: 4
  - Learning rate: 2e-5
  - Number of epochs: 3
  - Mixed precision training (fp16)

### Implementation Details
- Training pipeline implemented in `src/models/trainer.py`
- Configuration managed through `configs/model/training_config.yaml`
- Training script: `scripts/training/train_model.py`

## Future Plans

### Phase 2: DeepSeek Coder Integration
Planning to experiment with DeepSeek Coder as an alternative base model due to:
- Strong performance on technical documentation
- Better handling of structured data
- Potential for improved code generation capabilities

### Phase 3: Model Comparison
Will evaluate and compare:
- Mistral-7B based model
- DeepSeek Coder based model
- Other potential models (e.g., Llama-2, CodeLlama)

### Phase 4: Data Expansion
Future improvements will focus on:
- Expanding incident report examples
- Adding more medical protocol data
- Balancing task distribution
- Incorporating real-world feedback

### Phase 5: Deployment Optimization
Plans for:
- Model quantization for faster inference
- API development for integration
- Monitoring and feedback collection
- Continuous model improvements

## Current Status
- Initial fine-tuning pipeline implemented
- Base configuration with Mistral-7B established
- Ready for first training run
- Monitoring and evaluation metrics in place

## Next Steps
1. Complete initial Mistral-7B fine-tuning
2. Evaluate model performance on test set
3. Collect feedback from domain experts
4. Begin preparation for DeepSeek Coder integration
5. Expand training dataset
